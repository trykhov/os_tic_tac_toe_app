# OS React-Native Tic Tac Toe App

### Inspiration

This project was a project that I did while learning how to make mobile apps using React-Native. The course is from https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-native-bootcamp/. 
While the original design of this app used X's and O's, I wanted to do something a bit different for fun. So I decided to make it using Apple's and Google's icons.

In addition, aside from changing the layout, I also added a few other features:

• When the game is over, players cannot select a new element unless the game is reset

• When a player wins, it shows an alert as opposed to a text on the screen

• Changed the color layout and added a title

Here's a demo:
